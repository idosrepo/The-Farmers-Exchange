FARMX - "The-Farmers-Exchange" is our project which helps us to bridge the gap between carbon gas emmittor and carbon gas consumer.

Our proposed application will be used for tracking the carbon gases emission and consumption. Emitter and consumer will update their data into the system. OR Our system will capture the real time data.We can easily find out the gap (if any) in emission and consumption of carbon gases. The systemâ€™s dashboard will guide us or suggest us what to do in case of there is gap.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

One of the major element in current climate change is excess of carbon gases emission. The carbon gases consumers are not able to consume all the carbon emissions. There is no system to track the emission and consumption.

### How can technology help?

We are proposing / developing a system which tracks the emission and consuption of carbon gases. Our dashboard will show the real time data. We can guide about how to minimize the gap and overcome from access of carbon gases.

### The idea

The idea is to create a carbon free environment. 

## Demo video

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the system and see the dashboard with real time data of carbon gases emission and consuption.
2. The user can update the values / data and generate reports.
3. The reports can be used to send to consumers. This will help to enhance the consuption.

## Long description

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
- Feature 4

It's in a free tier IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. In the future we plan to run on Red Hat OpenShift, for example.

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
